## Lesson 14: Proving God's Existence

1. Since the existence of God can be proved by human reason, an
argument exists that will convince every person. True or false?
2. The Church teaches that Aquinas’s “five ways,” as he phrases them
in the Summa Theologiae, are successful proofs. True or false?
3. To be successful, an argument for God’s existence needs to show
that the God of the Bible exists. True or false?
